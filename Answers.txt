• What does fast-forward in git mean?

Fast-forward usually happens when the master branch can be merged with a branch
directly given that the branch just modified something in master branch and in other
words, it's a modified version of master branch so that we can directly merge master
with this branch. 

• Why should you have different branches? 

Different branches are used to manage the project easily and to isolate the work of an 
Individual from the team. Developers need to create seperate branches for the features, 
and after that if everything goes well.They can merge it with release branch and when 
the release branch is ready it should be merged with master. If we follow this procedure, 
even if there's any problem with feature branch, it should be resolved back before in 
release branch.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have? 

We can make as many git repositories as much as the team wants. But it should be in a manner
That there shouldn't be more repositories for a single domain. For example, the mobile app 
project might need different repositories for android and iOS and it might need one other 
Repository for testing. We can even combine all the repositories(android, iOS, testing) 
into a single one by adding them in different branches on the same repository.
